This app was developed as the final course project for the JHU **Data Science Capstone Course**. The aim was to buld a predictive text algorithm with a ShinyApp front end to predict the next word based on a user's inputs. Estimations in this app are based on the sample of a corpus from US News, Twitter and Blogs. 

###User Guide
1. Navigate to the **Next Word Prediction Tab**
2. In the box on the left hand side type in the sentence you want to predict the next word of - this will begin predicting as you start typing
3. The algorithm will take some time to think (depending on the length of the sentence this could be 10-15 seconds plus) and will display the prediction on the right hand side
